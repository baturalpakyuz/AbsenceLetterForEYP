# AbsenceLetterForEYP
AbsenceLetterForEYP is a lightweight desktop application designed specifically for members of the European Youth Parliament (EYP), with a primary focus on the needs of EYP Türkiye.

The application streamlines the process of generating formal absence letters for EYP sessions. It produces a signed letter template that includes customizable placeholders:

xxxxx → Delegate's or official's name

ttttt → Name of the EYP conference

ddddd → Official conference dates

While using this application, please make sure you have used a template that is signed and has correct placeholders.

By automating this process, the project aims to reduce administrative overhead for the NC and organisers while ensuring professional and consistent academic or institutional approval documentation.

Whether you're a delegate needing an official excuse letter for school or a board member managing multiple participants, AbsenceLetterForEYP provides a simple, elegant solution.
